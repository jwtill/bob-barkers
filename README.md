## About this project
![screenshot of project](/everything-screenshot.jpg)

This project was created as a team week project to mark the end of our Epicodus Intermediate JavaScript module. We created a simple game based on The Price Is Right, inviting the player to guess the price of Amazon items. Inspiration for this project came from Tom Watson's [Wikitrivia](https://wikitrivia.tomjwatson.com/).
